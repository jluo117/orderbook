#How to run  
To execute the buy and sell test run node `buySell.js` This test will execute basic buy and sell function given the amount avalible  
To check quantity of each item at a certain price, run `quantity.js`. This will call both buy and sell orders and will out put the total amount for two diffrent prices  
To check the sync function run the `sync.js` file which takes in `sync.json` as the save file and adds that information into our dataset.  
#Compromises  
Some of the compromises that was made was not having enough time to check if the states of the json file was valid  
Another thing is that the directory of the load file is relative to where `index.js` is and not relative to where the script was executed.
